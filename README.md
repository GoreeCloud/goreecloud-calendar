# GoreeCloud Calendar

Privacy-first, self-hosted calendar application for the GoreeCloud Suite.

## Role

GoreeCloud Calendar is the user-facing application for calendars, events, scheduling, agenda and availability workflows. Its canonical application address is `https://calendar.goreecloud.com`.

The shared Radicale service at `https://dav.goreecloud.com` remains the authoritative CalDAV service. Calendar is an application and presentation layer over that standards-based data boundary rather than a second authoritative calendar store.

## Current foundation

The repository now includes:

- timezone-safe calendar event domain primitives and busy-interval merging;
- a fail-closed CalDAV transport foundation with HTTPS-only configuration, cross-origin refusal, authenticated discovery, ETag-protected writes/deletes, and iCalendar serialization;
- the strict GoreeCloud Tasks projection consumer and bidirectional Tasks integration contract;
- Glaze UI 1.3 baseline tokens/components with accessibility and resilience fallbacks;
- dependency-free unit/contract tests suitable for CI.

This is a source foundation, not production acceptance. Production publication, production DAV credentials, user migration, monitoring, backup/recovery evidence, and live target-environment validation remain separate controlled work.

## First-party Tasks integration

GoreeCloud Calendar and GoreeCloud Tasks are peer first-party applications. Calendar remains authoritative for native event semantics and authorized busy-time context; Tasks remains authoritative for task content, workflow, completion, assignment, and recurrence.

Integration uses versioned application APIs. Neither application may read or write the other's database directly or broaden a user's permissions through a service credential. See `docs/tasks-integration-contract.md`.

## Architecture and readiness

See `docs/product-foundation.md` for product scope, DAV boundaries, Glaze UI expectations, security/privacy requirements, and production-readiness gates.

## Development

Run the dependency-free test suite with:

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```
